Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox. After the fix, the |attr filter no longer bypasses the environment's attribute lookup. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.1.6. A flaw was found in Jinja.

It is simple to exploit, could significantly impact availability, and there is not a suitable mitigation for all use cases. Once an attack has ended, the system should return to normal operations on its own.
This vulnerability only impacts servers which have HTTP/2 enabled. It stems from an imperfect definition of the protocol. As the Go programming language is widely utilized across nearly every major Red Hat offering, a full listing of impacted packages will not be provided. Therefore, the “Affected Packages and Issued Red Hat Security Errata” section contains a simplified list of what offerings need to remediate this vulnerability. Every impacted offering has at least one representative component listed, but potentially not all of them. Rest assured that Red Hat is committed to remediating this vulnerability across our entire portfolio.
Many components are rated as Low impact due to configurations which reduce the attack surface or  significantly increase the difficulty of exploitation. A summary of these scenarios are:
* The container includes a package that provides a vulnerable webserver, but it is not used or running during operation
* HTTP/2 is disabled by default and is not supported
* Only a client implementation is provided, which is not vulnerable
* A vulnerable module (either golang.org/net/http or golang.org/x/net/http2) is included, but disabled
* Access to a vulnerable server is restricted within the container (loopback only connections)
* Golang is available in the container but is not used
Within the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the majority of vulnerable components are not externally accessible. This means an attacker must already have access to a container within your environment to exploit this vulnerability. However, the ose-hyperkube (openshift-enterprise-hyperkube) container is externally accessible, so there are less barriers to exploitation. Fixes for this specific container are already available.
Within Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, the impacted component is Receptor. The impact has been reduced to Low as the vulnerable code is present, but not utilized. There are three potential exposures within this component:
* Receptor utilizes QUIC a UDP based protocol which does not run over HTTP/2
* Receptor utilizes the x/net/ipv4 and ipv6 packages, both of which are not affected</td>

While the vulnerability can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the Python process, it requires specific conditions to trigger: a mismatch between the provided certificate's public key and private key, coupled with the use of an encryption algorithm with hmac_hash set.
The exploitation of this vulnerability does not directly lead to arbitrary code execution or data leakage. Instead, it causes a controlled termination of the Python process, which, although disruptive, is not as critical as other vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized access, data corruption, or code injection. However, it's important to note that denial-of-service conditions can still have operational impacts, disrupting services or causing system instability.

An attacker can cause its peer to run out of memory sending a large number of PATH_CHALLENGE frames. The receiver is supposed to respond to each PATH_CHALLENGE frame with a PATH_RESPONSE frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending out (the vast majority of) these PATH_RESPONSE frames by collapsing the peers congestion window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and by manipulating the peer's RTT estimate. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 0.37.7, 0.38.2 and 0.39.4. A memory exhaustion vulnerability was found in Quic-GO, where a malicious client exploits the path validation mechanism to induce the server into accumulating an unbounded queue of PATH_RESPONSE frames, depleting its memory. The attacker controls the victim's packet send rate by overwhelming the server with numerous packets containing PATH_CHALLENGE frames. Through selective acknowledgments of received packets and manipulation of peer's Round-Trip Time (RTT) estimates, the attacker induces congestion control mechanisms to reduce the server's send rate significantly. Consequently, the victim server is compelled to store an increasing number of queued PATH_RESPONSE frames, resulting in memory exhaustion.</td>

                        <td>Requests is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0. A flaw was found in the Python-requests package, where it is vulnerable to potentially leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers, specifically during redirects to an HTTPS origin. This is a product of how rebuild_proxies is used to recompute and reattach the Proxy-Authorization header to requests when redirected. This behavior only affects proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (for example, https://username:password@proxy:8080).</td>

By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially, this can be done after completion of the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2.</td>

                        <td>CVE-2024-45230 is classified as a moderate severity vulnerability because, while it presents a potential denial-of-service (DoS) risk, it does not directly expose the application to data breaches or arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability arises from inefficient handling of very large inputs with specific character sequences in the `urlize()` and `urlizetrunc()` functions. However, the attack requires carefully crafted input and only leads to resource exhaustion (such as CPU or memory overload) under specific conditions, making it less likely to be exploited in typical production environments. This reduces its impact compared to vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access or significant system compromise, hence the moderate severity rating.</td>

                        <td>quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. Prior to version 0.42.0, an attacker can cause its peer to run out of memory sending a large number of `NEW_CONNECTION_ID` frames that retire old connection IDs. The receiver is supposed to respond to each retirement frame with a `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending out (the vast majority of) these `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frames by collapsing the peers congestion window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and by manipulating the peer's RTT estimate. Version 0.42.0 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available. A flaw was found in quic-go. This issue may allow an attacker to trigger a denial of service by sending a large number of NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames that retire old connection IDs.
