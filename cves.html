Starting in version 1.0 and prior to 2.6.0, the Streaming API improperly handles highly compressed data. urllib3's streaming API is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once. When streaming a compressed response, urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP Content-Encoding header (e.g., gzip, deflate, br, or zstd). The library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation. The decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation. This can result in excessive resource consumption (high CPU usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data.</td>

Once an attack has ended, the system should return to normal operations on its own.
This vulnerability only impacts servers which have HTTP/2 enabled. It stems from an imperfect definition of the protocol. As the Go programming language is widely utilized across nearly every major Red Hat offering, a full listing of impacted packages will not be provided. Therefore, the “Affected Packages and Issued Red Hat Security Errata” section contains a simplified list of what offerings need to remediate this vulnerability. Every impacted offering has at least one representative component listed, but potentially not all of them. Rest assured that Red Hat is committed to remediating this vulnerability across our entire portfolio.
Many components are rated as Low impact due to configurations which reduce the attack surface or  significantly increase the difficulty of exploitation. A summary of these scenarios are:
* The container includes a package that provides a vulnerable webserver, but it is not used or running during operation
* HTTP/2 is disabled by default and is not supported
* Only a client implementation is provided, which is not vulnerable
* A vulnerable module (either golang.org/net/http or golang.org/x/net/http2) is included, but disabled
* Access to a vulnerable server is restricted within the container (loopback only connections)
* Golang is available in the container but is not used
Within the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, the majority of vulnerable components are not externally accessible. This means an attacker must already have access to a container within your environment to exploit this vulnerability. However, the ose-hyperkube (openshift-enterprise-hyperkube) container is externally accessible, so there are less barriers to exploitation. Fixes for this specific container are already available.
Within Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, the impacted component is Receptor. The impact has been reduced to Low as the vulnerable code is present, but not utilized. There are three potential exposures within this component:
* Receptor utilizes QUIC a UDP based protocol which does not run over HTTP/2

The exploitation of this vulnerability does not directly lead to arbitrary code execution or data leakage. Instead, it causes a controlled termination of the Python process, which, although disruptive, is not as critical as other vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized access, data corruption, or code injection. However, it's important to note that denial-of-service conditions can still have operational impacts, disrupting services or causing system instability.

This vulnerability arises because the class allows the use of arbitrary XSLT stylesheets, which are parsed using lxml.etree.parse() and lxml.etree.XSLT() without any hardening measures. In lxml versions up to 4.9.x, external entities are resolved by default, allowing attackers to read arbitrary local files or perform outbound HTTP(S) fetches. In lxml versions 5.0 and above, while entity expansion is disabled, the XSLT document() function can still read any URI unless XSLTAccessControl is applied. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to gain read-only access to any file the LangChain process can reach, including sensitive files such as SSH keys, environment files, source code, or cloud metadata. No authentication, special privileges, or user interaction are required, and the issue is exploitable in default deployments that enable custom XSLT.</td>

Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling') vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.
The platform uses secure, encrypted HTTPS connections over TLS 1.2 to reduce the risk of smuggling attacks by preventing the injection of ambiguous or malformed requests between components. The environment employs IPS/IDS and antimalware solutions to detect and block malicious code while ensuring consistent interpretation of HTTP requests across network layers, mitigating request/response inconsistencies. Event logs are collected and analyzed for centralization, correlation, monitoring, alerting, and retention, enabling the detection of malformed or suspicious HTTP traffic. Static code analysis and peer reviews enforce strong input validation and error handling to ensure all user inputs adhere to HTTP protocol specifications.</td>

Within regulated environments, a combination of the following controls acts as a significant barrier to successfully exploiting a CWE-115: Misinterpretation of Input vulnerability and therefore downgrades the severity of this particular CVE from Moderate to Low.
Controls such as input validation and error handling mitigate input misinterpretation risks by enforcing strict validation rules and secure error management. Error handling ensures inputs are validated against predefined formats, preventing malformed data from being misinterpreted. Techniques like strong typing, allow listing, and proper encoding reduce the likelihood of injection attacks and unintended code execution. Input validation also ensures that errors do not expose sensitive system details or cause unpredictable behavior. Secure error handling prevents information leakage through detailed error messages while preserving system stability under malformed input conditions. Together, these controls reduce the attack surface by maintaining consistent input processing and preventing exploitable system states, strengthening the overall security posture.</td>

The environment employs malicious code protections, including IDS/IPS and antimalware tools to detect threats and monitor resource usage, helping prevent uncontrolled consumption that could lead to system failure. Additional safeguards, such as web application firewalls and load-balancing strategies, protect against resource exhaustion and performance degradation. Event logs are centrally collected, correlated, and analyzed to support monitoring, alerting, and retention, aiding in the detection of abnormal behavior and potential denial-of-service (DoS) conditions. Static code analysis and peer reviews enforce strong input validation and error handling, reducing the likelihood of input-based DoS attacks.</td>

The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which are thus also vulnerable. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-14232. An inefficient regular expression complexity was found in Django. The text truncator regular expressions exhibit linear backtracking complexity, which can be slow, leading to a potential denial of service, given certain HTML inputs.</td>

This is a product of how we use `rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0. A flaw was found in the Python-requests package, where it is vulnerable to potentially leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers, specifically during redirects to an HTTPS origin. This is a product of how rebuild_proxies is used to recompute and reattach the Proxy-Authorization header to requests when redirected. This behavior only affects proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (for example, https://username:password@proxy:8080).</td>

                        <td>This issue is classified as Moderate because exploitation requires the attacker to have administrative access (or successfully social engineer a legitimate admin). A malicious or tricked admin can create a deceptive route with a double-slash path that captures user credentials in cleartext, potentially allowing persistent backdoor access even after the admin’s permissions are revoked. The gateway does not normalize or validate these paths, meaning normal users cannot detect the attack through ordinary API use. Although an attacker cannot exploit this without access to route creation, the combination of privileged requirements and complete credential exposure makes this a moderate severity risk in any environment where multiple users rely on gateway authentication.</td>

Successful exploitation requires the attacker to first obtain a valid CSRF form token tied to the victim’s session, which is generally protected by browser same-origin policies and modern CSRF mitigations—making token theft non-trivial without an existing compromise or major misconfiguration. Additionally, the gateway is still performing Referer checks when TLS edge termination is in place, which, while not as strict as Origin validation, reduces exposure in many real-world setups. The need for a valid authenticated session and precise token alignment means the attacker cannot simply trick a user into visiting a malicious site and execute arbitrary state-changing requests; they must overcome multiple layered controls.</td>

While remote exploitation is possible without authentication (PR:N, UI:N), the attack requires a high degree of skill and knowledge to craft malicious URLs that will be logged. The impact is limited to confidentiality and integrity; specifically, the ability to manipulate log output. This allows an attacker to potentially forge log entries, which could be used for social engineering or to obscure malicious activity. While the impact isn't arbitrary code execution or a denial of service, the ability to manipulate logs presents a security risk, especially given that logs are often used for auditing and security monitoring. The Confidentiality impact is rated 'Low' as the information leaked is limited to the manipulated log entries themselves, not sensitive data. The Scope is changed to 'C' to reflect that the vulnerability affects only the logging component.

* Exploitation requires that the attacker have limited code execution access to a Python environment where they can trigger the vulnerable PackageIndex.download() function—this might be via a script, plugin, or automated job. Full admin rights aren't needed but a user with no access at all will be unable to exploit this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability impacts the integrity of the system within the same security boundary—it does not enable access or compromise across trust boundaries (e.g., from one container to another or from user space to kernel).
* Successful exploitation only allows the attacker to "create" new files. The vulnerability does not provide access to existing files and by an extension to any confidential information. 
* Arbitrary file writes can overwrite critical config files, executables, or scripts. This can lead to persistent code execution, system misconfiguration, or unauthorized behavior, especially in automated environments. While overwriting critical files could theoretically lead to service disruption, the vulnerability in isolation does not inherently cause denial of service.

                        <td>quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO, the kernel would then return a "message too large" error on sendmsg, i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially, this can be done after completion of the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2. A vulnerability was found in Quic-Go where an attacker can inject malicious data into network packets, potentially allowing them to cause harm. The issue arises from a configuration option used by some affected versions of the code that sends out information about packet size limitations. As a result, when Quic-Go attempts to send a packet larger than it claims to be able to handle, the operating system will reject it due to a "message too large" error.</td>

                        <td>AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Prior to version 3.12.14, the Python parser is vulnerable to a request smuggling vulnerability due to not parsing trailer sections of an HTTP request. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. Version 3.12.14 contains a patch for this issue. A request smuggling flaw was found in the aiohttp python library. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed, without the usual C extensions, for example, or if AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled, an attacker can execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections.</td>
